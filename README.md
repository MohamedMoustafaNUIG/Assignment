The C code in this repository does 3 main procedures:

1)It deals 2 hands with each hand made up of 5 cards.

  All cards in each hands are unique, and a hand is assigned for the user(You) and the Dealer.
  
2)It compares the cards in each hand with the respective card in the other hand to find which has the highest number.

  It then displays each winner and the one with the most wins.
  
3)It displays the number of hands dealt before a hand which compromises of 4 unique Aces is dealt.
