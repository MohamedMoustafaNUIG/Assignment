This project does three tasks:

* It deals 2 hands with each hand made up of 5 cards.All cards are unique, and a hand is assigned for the user(You) and the Dealer.
  
* It compares the cards in each hand with the respective card in the other hand to find which has the highest number. It then displays the winner of each round as well as the side with the most wins (ie final winner).
  
* It displays the number of hands dealt before a hand having 4 Aces (each of a different suit) is dealt.
